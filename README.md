## Event Handbook
This handbook contains all the necessary information for participants of the event. If you have any queries about the materials provided or find a problem, please email [helpdesk@joefennell.org](mailto:helpdesk@joefennell.org)

## 1. The Challenge
Through our partnerships with UKRI STFC, STFC Hartree Centre, IBM Research, and the [Centre for Sustainable Agriculture](https://csa-india.org/) we have identified a need to provide smallholder farmers with timely and location-specific advice about the crop types and varieties they should grow. Our challenge for the hackathon is to bring together hugely varied datasets - from market price data to soil maps - to design an integrated **open access** platform for recommending crop type, planting date and management advice for smallholder farmers in India.

## 2. Pre-event activities
