## FRONT-END
The Crop Helper demonstration app for Android implements the "backend" API functionality and allows a user to search the database for crops and find suitable fertilizers and pesticides to aid in growing said crop. There is also a cost breakdown, however most of it is "hard coded" for the demonstration due to time limitations.
